# MonsterWorld
Small RPG Project from SkillFactory lessons.

Keep in mind that the code is edited in pieces and will be collected as I move further in the Java course.

The concept of this "RPG"
--> Have a battle ground where monsters are created and where they battle each other to death. Basically.
